select * from MarksView;


3) Updating View:

INSERT INTO DetailsView (Name, Address) VALUES ("Suresh", "Loni");

select * from DetailsView;

select * from Student_Details;


4) Deleting a row from a View:

DELETE FROM DetailsView WHERE Name = "Suresh";

SELECT * FROM DetailsView;

SELECT * FROM Student_Details;

5) Deleting a View:

Drop View DetailsView;

SELECT * FROM DetailsView;

SELECT * FROM Student_Detail;
